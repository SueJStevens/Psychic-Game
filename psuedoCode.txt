//Game Starts
--wins starts at zero (hard coded into the HTML)
--losses starts at zero (hard coded into the HTML)
--Guesses Left starts at 9
--Guesses so far starts at blank (hard coded as blank but also js resets)

//app randomly picks a letter from an array of the alphabet

//user types in a guess

//translate user's guess to lower case (or upper case) to ensure consistency

***IF User's Choice does not match Computer Pick then 
--reduce remaining guesses
--add to display of guesses so far (i.e., a, b, c, d, etc.)
***END IF

***IF User's Choice equals Computer Pick then
--increase Wins by one
--reset guesses Left to 9
--reset guesses so far to blank
--computer picks new letter
***END IF

***WHEN Guesses Left = 0
--increment Losses count by 1
--reset guesses Left to 9
--reset guesses so far to blank
--computer picks new letter


//add to display of guesses so far (i.e., a, b, c, d, etc.)
--should guesses be displayed in the case the user typed?

Game never ends???
